# Midwest Agricutlural Trednds

Jacob Trout

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

My current goal is to investigate and highlight trends in key field crop growth in the Midwest. I have reduced the scale of my initial proposal to a region analysis due to some data constraints. 

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

I have struggled to find quality climate data at the county (or near-county) level. Thus I have removed it from the project as of now. 

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.

### 1 - Crop Production over Time by Crop
This Graph highlights how production of Corn, Wheat and Soybeans has change between the 1960s and present day. The goal is to show how the relative significance of each crop has changed over time.

### 2 - Aggregate Crop Production over time by state
This graph highlights how total crop production varies across states over time. It gives a sense of the most important states in production.

### 3 - Aggregate Acres Planted over time by states
This graph highlights how the total amount of land used to plant key crops varies across states over time. It gives us a different angle on the relative importance of each state in aggricultural production.


## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking? (An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)
